Wordle
 - 
This is a wordle clone played in the console. 
When the script runs the player will be prompted to enter a word.
If the input is invalid due to entering characters not in the alphabet or invalid words the player will be asked to inout a new word.
The letters are coloured using the colorama pacakage. The letters are coloured in a similar fashion to wordle.

Potential improvements

- A better user interface could be used such as rich or pygame.
