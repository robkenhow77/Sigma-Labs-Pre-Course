Global Scope:

Global scope refers to variables stored that can be accessed anywhere in the script. They are defined in the main section of the script. 
If using a global variable within a function it must be stated that it is a global variable. 
Lobal variables exist for the entire duration of the script while it is running.

Local Scope:

Local scope refers to variables defined within a function. These variables can only be accessed within the function. 
If called outside of a function an error will arrive due to the undefined variable. 
If using the name of a global variable within a function the local variable will be used. Once a local variable is used it is destroyed.
